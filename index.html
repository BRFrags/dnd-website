                    <h1>The Club</h1>
                    <p>Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a communal role-playing game in which a party of players work together to conquer great evils, battle ancient dragons, or go shopping for supplies with their characters they have made. The adventure or story is thought up by the Dungeon Master (DM) who runs the game and is half storyteller and half referee through the game. The game was originally developed by Gary Gygax in the 80â€™s and is now run by a company called Wizards of the Coast, who also hold the licence for Magic the Gathering.</p> 
                    <p>The Westlake D&D club is a casual space for anyone who is up for a bit of adventure to meetup and have some fun. We currently have around 75 members and growing and all our DMs are students who lead tables of 5-8 players every fortnight. Everyone is welcome and it is easy to get playing at a table right away once you have made your character.
                    </p>
                    <p>Welcome to the world of D&D, look around the site for more information.</p>
